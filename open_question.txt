To improve this project, it could be possible to improve the function createAllFreqTables so it creates the frequency tables only for datas
that are not numerical. A frequency table of numerical data is not interesing at all.
To maintain code's quality, it is important to limit the activity of future's function to only one functionality. 
Therefore, the code is easily reusable and understandable.
